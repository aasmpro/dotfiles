1. First 92 bytes are 0x00
2. Each file are started with 55AA 5AA5
3. Then 4 bytes for Header Length
4. Then 4 bytes for Unknown1
5. Then 8 bytes for Hardware ID
6. Then 4 bytes for File Sequence
7. Then 4 bytes for File Size
8. Then 16 byts for File Date
9. Then 16 byts for File Time
10.Then 16 byts for File Type
11.Then 16 byts for Blank1
12.Then 2 bytes for Header Checksum
13.Then 2 bytes for BlockSize
14.Then 2 bytes for Blank2
15.Then ($headerLength-98) bytes for file checksum
16.Then data file length bytes for files.
17.Then padding if have
18.Then repeat 2 to 17
